### Authentication configuration (Supabase)

If OAuth redirects send you back to localhost when using the production site, ensure these settings in Supabase:

- In Authentication → URL Configuration:
	- Site URL: https://stickynoter.vercel.app
	- Additional Redirect URLs:
		- https://stickynoter.vercel.app/auth/callback
		- http://localhost:3000/auth/callback (for local dev)
		- (optional) any preview URLs you use
- In Authentication → Providers → Google: Authorized redirect URI should be your Supabase callback URL (format: https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback). Do not put your website URL there.
